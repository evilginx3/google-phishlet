Google Phishlet 

A Google phishlet is a pre-configured script or template used with the Evilginx3 tool to simulate a phishing page that looks like Google's login page. Phishlets are essentially customized configurations for Evilginx3 that mimic legitimate websites in order to steal credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive data when a victim interacts with the fake page.
